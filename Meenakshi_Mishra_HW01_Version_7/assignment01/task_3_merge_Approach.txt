As we know, the two lists are of size 1000 each
Both of them are already sorted in the order of relevence with their seed topics. 

In order to merge both the lists into one list of at most 1000 links

Say List for SustainableEnergy is L1
and List for SolarPower is L2
and the result list is of size 1000

Then, every time we take one element from L1 and L2 
untill the result size reaches 1000
compare if they are same
>>>>if yes
       we discard one of them and 
       check if it already is in result list 
          if yes >>> discard the link and continue
          if no  >>> save the link and continue
>>>>if no
     check for both individually if they exist in the result list 
     if they do then discard them and continue
     if they don't then save them in the result and continue

then output result list
