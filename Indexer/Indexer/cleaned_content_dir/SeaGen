seagen  wikipedia seagen seagen is the world's first large scale commercial tidal stream generator[1][2][3] it was four times more powerful than any other tidal stream generator in the world at the time of installation[4] the first seagen generator was installed in strangford narrows between strangford and portaferry in northern ireland uk in april 2008 and was connected to the grid in july 2008[5] it generates 1.2 mw for between 18 and 20 hours a day while the tides are forced in and out of strangford lough through the narrows[6] strangford lough was also the site of the very first known tide mill in the world the nendrum monastery mill where remains dating from 787 have been excavated contents 1 background 2 technology 3 environmental impact 4 problems 5 references 6 external links background[] the seagen rotors can be raised above the surface for maintenance seagen's predecessor the 300 kw 'seaflow' turbine off the north coast of devon marine current turbines the developer of seagen demonstrated first prototype of tidal stream generator in 1994 with a 15 kilowatt system in loch linnhe off the west coast of scotland in may 2003 the prototype for seagen 'seaflow' was installed off the coast of lynmouth north devon england[6] seaflow was a single rotor turbine which generated 300 kw but was not connected to the grid seaflow was the world's first offshore tidal generator and remained the world's largest until seagen was installed[7] technology[] seagen generator weighs 300 tonnes[3][8] each driving a generator through a gearbox like a hydro-electric or wind turbine these turbines have a patented feature by which the rotor blades can be pitched through 180 degrees allowing them to operate in both flow directions – on ebb and flood tides the company claims a capacity factor of 0.59 (average of the last 2000 hours) the power units of each system are mounted on arm-like extensions either side of a tubular steel monopile some 3 metres (9.8 ft) in diameter and the arms with the power units can be raised above the surface for safe and easy maintenance access[1] the seagen was built at belfast's harland and wolff's shipyards[9] environmental impact[] 400 million gallons of water flow in and out of strangford lough twice a day seagen has been licensed to operate over a period of 5 years during which there will be a comprehensive environmental monitoring programme to determine the precise impact on the marine environment[10] problems[] during the commissioning of the system a software error caused the blades of one of the turbines to be damaged this left the turbine operating at half power until autumn 2008 the incident is being investigated and mct is confident that it will not happen again[11] full power operation was finally achieved on 18 dec 2008[12] references[] ^ a b douglas ca; harrison gp; chick jp (2008)  (pdf) proceedings of the institution of mechanical engineers part m: journal of engineering for the maritime environment professional engineering publishing 222 (1): 1–12 doi:10.1243/14750902jeme94 retrieved 20080710 ^ "the rise of british sea power" the independent 20080323 retrieved 20080730 ^ a b julian rush (20080331) "power generation: the new wave" channel 4 retrieved 20080730 ^ arthur strain (20080208) "sea change for energy generation" bbc retrieved 20080710 ^ first connection to the grid ^ a b brittany sauser (20080729) "tidal power comes to market a large-scale tidal-power unit has started up in northern ireland" technology review inc massachusetts institute of technology retrieved 20080730 ^ "case studies for schools: tidal power" department for business enterprise and regulatory reform retrieved 20080710 ^ "world's first as £12m turbine installed in strangford lough" belfast telegraph 20080331 retrieved 20080730 ^ henry mcdonald (20080331) "tidal power comes to northern ireland" guardian retrieved 20080730 ^ david g erwin "environmental monitoring liaison and consultation concerning the mct strangford lough turbine" (pdf) retrieved 20080710 ^ "delay in commissioning one of seagen's rotors" marine current turbines 20080722 retrieved 20080730 ^ "tidal energy system on full power" bbc 20081218 retrieved 20090625 external links[] sea generation ltd marine current turbines ltd retrieved from "" categories: tidal stream generatorstidal power stations in northern irelandhidden categories: coordinates on wikidata navigation menu search this page was last modified on 18 january 2017 at 01:51 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license; additional terms may apply  by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement
