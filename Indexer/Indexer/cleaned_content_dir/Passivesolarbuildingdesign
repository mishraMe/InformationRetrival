passive solar building design in passive solar building design windows walls and floors are made to collect store and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer this is called passive solar design because unlike active solar heating systems it does not involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices1 the key to design a passive solar building

contrasted to active solar such technologies convert sunlight into usable heat in water air and thermal mass cause airmovement for ventilating or future use with little use of other energy sources a common example is a solarium on the equatorside of a building passive cooling is the use of the same design principles to reduce summer cooling requirements some passive systems use a small amount of conventional energy to control dampers shutters night insulation and other devices that enhance solar energy collection storage and use and reduce undesirable heat transfer passive solar technologies include direct and indirect solar gain for space heating solar water heating systems based on the thermosiphon use of thermal mass and phasechange materials for slowing indoor air temperature swings solar cookers the solar chimney for enhancing natural ventilation and earth sheltering more widely passive solar technologies include the solar furnace but this typically requires some external energy for aligning their concentrating mirrors or receivers and historically have not proven to be practical or cost effective for widespread use lowgrade energy needs such as space and water heating have proven over time to be better applications for passive use of solar energy as a science the scientific basis for passive solar building design has been developed from a combination of climatology

comprehensive us department of energy energy plus3 building energy simulation software and application of decades of lessons learned since the 1970s energy crisis can achieve significant energy savings and reduction of environmental damage without sacrificing functionality or aesthetics4 in fact passivesolar design features such as a greenhousesunroomsolarium can greatly enhance the livability daylight views and value of a home at a low cost per unit of space much has been learned about passive solar building design since the 1970s energy crisis many unscientific intuitionbased expensive construction experiments have attempted and failed to achieve zero energy  the total elimination of heatingandcooling energy bills passive solar building construction may not be difficult or expensive using offtheshelf existing materials and technology but the scientific passive solar building design is a nontrivial engineering effort that requires significant study of previous counterintuitive lessons learned and time to enter evaluate and iteratively refine the simulation input and output one of the most useful postconstruction evaluation tools has been the use of thermography using digital thermal imaging cameras for a formal quantitative scientific energy audit thermal imaging can be used to document areas of poor thermal performance such as the negative thermal impact of roofangled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day the scientific lessons learned over the last three decades have been captured in sophisticated comprehensive building energy simulation computer software systems like us doe energy plus scientific passive solar building design with quantitative cost benefit product optimization is not easy for a novice the level of complexity has resulted in ongoing badarchitecture and many intuitionbased unscientific construction experiments that disappoint their designers and waste a significant portion of their construction budget on inappropriate ideas5 the economic motivation for scientific design and engineering is significant if it had been applied comprehensively to new building construction beginning in 1980 based on 1970s lessons learned america could be saving over 250,000,000 per year on expensive energy and related pollution today5 since 1979 passive solar building design has been a critical element of achieving zero energy by educational institution experiments and governments around the world including the us department of energy and the energy research scientists that they have supported for decades the cost effective proof of concept was established decades ago but cultural assimilation into architecture construction trades and buildingowner decision making has been very slow and difficult to change5 the new terms architectural science and architectural technology are being added to some schools of architecture with a future goal of teaching the above scientific and energyengineering principlescitation needed the solar path in passive design solar altitude over a year latitude based on new york new york main articles sun path and position of the sun the ability to achieve these goals simultaneously is fundamentally dependent on the seasonal variations in the suns path throughout the day this occurs as a result of the inclination of the earths axis of rotation in relation to its orbit the sun path is unique for any given latitude in northern hemisphere nontropical latitudes farther than 23.5 degrees from the equator the sun will reach its highest point toward the south in the direction of the equator as winter solstice approaches the angle at which the sun rises and sets progressively moves further toward the south and the daylight hours will become shorter the opposite is noted in summer where the sun will rise and set further toward the north and the daylight hours will lengthen6 the converse is observed in the southern hemisphere but the sun rises to the east and sets toward the west regardless of which hemisphere you are in in equatorial regions at less than 23.5 degrees the position of the sun at solar noon will oscillate from north to south and back again during the year7 in regions closer than 23.5 degrees from either northorsouth pole during summer the sun will trace a complete circle in the sky without setting whilst it will never appear above the horizon six months later during the height of winter8 the 47degree difference in the altitude of the sun at solar noon between winter and summer forms the basis of passive solar design this information is combined with local climatic data degree day heating and cooling requirements to determine at what time of the year solar gain will be beneficial for thermal comfort and when it should be blocked with shading by strategic placement of items such as glazing and shading devices the percent of solar gain entering a building can be controlled throughout the year one passive solar sun path design problem is that although the sun is in the same relative position six weeks before and six weeks after the solstice due to thermal lag from the thermal mass of the earth the temperature and solar gain requirements are quite different before and after the summer or winter solstice movable shutters shades shade screens or window quilts can accommodate daytoday and hourtohour solar gain and insulation requirements careful arrangement of rooms completes the passive solar design a common recommendation for residential dwellings is to place living areas facing solar noon and sleeping quarters on the opposite side9 a heliodon is a traditional movable light device used by architects and designers to help model sun path effects in modern times 3d computer graphics can visually simulate this data and calculate performance predictions4 passive solar heat transfer principles personal thermal comfort is a function of personal health factors medical psychological sociological and situational ambient air temperature mean radiant temperature air movement wind chill turbulence and relative humidity affecting human evaporative cooling heat transfer in buildings occurs through convection conduction and thermal radiation through roof walls floor and windows10 convective heat transfer convective heat transfer can be beneficial or detrimental uncontrolled air infiltration from poor weatherization  weatherstripping  draftproofing can contribute up to 40% of heat loss during winter11 however strategic placement of operable windows or vents can enhance convection crossventilation and summer cooling when the outside air is of a comfortable temperature and relative humidity12 filtered energy recovery ventilation systems may be useful to eliminate undesirable humidity dust pollen and microorganisms in unfiltered ventilation air natural convection causing rising warm air and falling cooler air can result in an uneven stratification of heat this may cause uncomfortable variations in temperature in the upper and lower conditioned space serve as a method of venting hot air or be designed in as a naturalconvection airflow loop for passive solar heat distribution and temperature equalization natural human cooling by perspiration and evaporation may be facilitated through natural or forced convective air movement by fans but ceiling fans can disturb the stratified insulating air layers at the top of a room and accelerate heat transfer from a hot attic or through nearby windows in addition high relative humidity inhibits evaporative cooling by humans radiative heat transfer the main source of heat transfer is radiant energy and the primary source is the sun solar radiation occurs predominantly through the roof and windows but also through walls thermal radiation moves from a warmer surface to a cooler one roofs receive the majority of the solar radiation delivered to a house a cool roof or green roof in addition to a radiant barrier can help prevent your attic from becoming hotter than the peak summer outdoor air temperature13 see albedo absorptivity emissivity and reflectivity windows are a ready and predictable site for thermal radiation14 energy from radiation can move into a window in the day time and out of the same window at night radiation uses photons to transmit electromagnetic waves through a vacuum or translucent medium solar heat gain can be significant even on cold clear days solar heat gain through windows can be reduced by insulated glazing shading and orientation windows are particularly difficult to insulate compared to roof and walls convective heat transfer through and around window coverings also degrade its insulation properties14 when shading windows external shading is more effective at reducing heat gain than internal window coverings14 western and eastern sun can provide warmth and lighting but are vulnerable to overheating in summer if not shaded in contrast the low midday sun readily admits light and warmth during the winter but can be easily shaded with appropriate length overhangs or angled louvres during summer and leaf bearing summer shade trees which shed their leaves in the fall the amount of radiant heat received is related to the location latitude altitude cloud cover and seasonal  hourly angle of incidence see sun path and lamberts cosine law another passive solar design principle is that thermal energy can be stored in certain building materials and released again when heat gain eases to stabilize diurnal daynight temperature variations the complex interaction of thermodynamic principles can be counterintuitive for firsttime designers precise computer modeling can help avoid costly construction experiments site specific

barriers and bulk insulation to minimise seasonal excessive heat gain or loss using thermal mass to store excess solar energy during the winter day which is then reradiated during the night17 the precise amount of equatorfacing glass and thermal mass should be based on careful consideration of latitude altitude climatic conditions and heatingcooling degree day requirements factors that can degrade thermal performance deviation from ideal orientation and northsoutheastwest aspect ratio excessive glass area overglazing resulting in overheating also resulting in glare and fading of soft furnishings and heat loss when ambient air temperatures fall installing glazing where solar gain during the day and thermal losses during the night cannot be controlled easily eg westfacing angled glazing skylights18 thermal losses through noninsulated or unprotected glazing lack of adequate shading during seasonal periods of high solar gain especially on the west wall incorrect application of thermal mass to modulate daily temperature variations open staircases leading to unequal distribution of warm air between upper and lower floors as warm air rises high building surface area to volume

technology in germany won the 2007 solar decathlon in washington dc with this passive house designed specifically for the humid and hot subtropical climate19 technically psh is highly efficient directgain systems can utilize ie convert into useful heat 6570% of the energy of solar radiation that strikes the aperture or collector passive solar fraction psf is the percentage of the required heat load met by psh and hence represents potential reduction in heating costs retscreen international has reported a psf of 2050% within the field of sustainability energy conservation even of the order of 15% is considered substantial other sources report the following psfs 525% for modest systems 40% for highly optimized systems up to 75% for very intense systems in favorable climates such as the southwest united states highly optimized systems can exceed 75% psf20 for more information see solar air heat key passive solar building configurations there are three primary passive solar energy configurations21 direct solar system indirect solar system isolated solar system direct solar system in a directgain passive solar system the indoor space acts as a solar collector heat absorber and distribution system southfacing glass in the northern hemispherenorthfacing in the southern hemisphere admits solar energy into the building interior where it directly heats radiant energy absorption or indirectly heats through convection thermal mass in the building such as concrete or masonry floors and walls the floors and walls acting as thermal mass are incorporated as functional parts of the building and temper the intensity of heating during the day at night the heated thermal mass radiates heat into the indoor space21 in cold climates a suntempered building is the most basic type of direct gain passive solar configuration that simply involves increasing slightly the southfacing glazing area without adding additional thermal mass it is a type of directgain system in which the building envelope is well insulated is elongated in an east–west direction and has a large fraction 80% or more of the windows on the south side it has little added thermal mass beyond what is already in the building ie just framing wall board and so forth in a suntempered building the southfacing window area should be limited to about 5 to 7% of the total floor area less in a sunny climate to prevent overheating additional southfacing glazing can be included only if more thermal mass is added energy savings are modest with this system and sun tempering is very low cost21 in genuine direct gain passive solar systems sufficient thermal mass is required to prevent large temperature fluctuations in indoor air more thermal mass is required than in a sun tempered building overheating of the building interior can result with insufficient or poorly designed thermal mass about onehalf to twothirds of the interior surface area of the floors walls and ceilings must be constructed of thermal storage materials thermal mass can be concrete adobe brick and water thermal mass in floors and walls should be kept keep as bare as is functionally and aesthetically possible thermal mass needs to be exposed to direct sunlight walltowall carpeting large throw rugs expansive furniture and large wall hangings should be avoided typically for about every 1 ft2 of southfacing glass about 5 to 10 ft3 of thermal mass is required for thermal mass 1 m3 per 5 to 10 m2 when accounting for minimaltoaverage wall and floor coverings and furniture this typically equates to about 5 to 10 ft2 per ft2 5 to 10 m2 per m2 of southfacing glass depending upon whether the sunlight strikes the surface directly the simplest rule of thumb is that thermal mass area should have an area of 5 to 10 times the surface area of the directgain collector glass area21 solid thermal mass eg concrete masonry stone etc should be relatively thin no more than about 4 in 100 mm thick thermal masses with large exposed areas and those in direct sunlight for at least part of the day 2 hour minimum perform best mediumtodark colors with high absorptivity should be used on surfaces of thermal mass elements that will be in direct sunlight thermal mass that is not in contact with sunlight can be any color lightweight elements eg drywall walls and ceilings can be any color covering the glazing with tightfitting moveable insulation panels during dark cloudy periods and nighttime hours will greatly enhance performance of a directgain system water contained within plastic or metal containment and placed in direct sunlight heats more rapidly and more evenly than solid mass due to natural convection heat transfer the convection process also prevents surface temperatures from becoming too extreme as they sometimes do when dark colored solid mass surfaces receive direct sunlight depending on climate and with adequate thermal mass southfacing glass area in a direct gain system should be limited to about 10 to 20% of the floor area eg 10 to 20 ft2 of glass for a 100 ft2 floor area this should be based on the net glass or glazing area note that most windows have a net glassglazing area that is 75 to 85% of the overall window unit area above this level problems with overheating glare and fading of fabrics are likely21 indirect solar system in an indirectgain passive solar system the thermal mass concrete masonry or water is located directly behind the southfacing glass and in front of the heated indoor space and so there is no direct heating the position of the mass prevents sunlight from entering the indoor space and can also obstruct the view through the glass there are two types of indirect gain systems thermal storage wall systems and roof pond systems21 thermal storage trombe walls in a thermal storage wall system often called a trombe wall a massive wall is located directly behind southfacing glass which absorbs solar energy and releases it selectively towards the building interior at night the wall can be constructed of castinplace concrete brick adobe stone or solid or filled concrete masonry units sunlight enters through the glass and is immediately absorbed at the surface of the mass wall and either stored or conducted through the material mass to the inside space the thermal mass cannot absorb solar energy as fast as it enters the space between the mass and the window area temperatures of the air in this space can easily exceed 120 °f 49 °c this hot air can be introduced into interior spaces behind the wall by incorporating heatdistributing vents at the top of the wall this wall system was first envisioned and patented in 1881 by its inventor edward morse felix trombe for whom this system is sometimes named was a french engineer who built several homes using this design in the french pyrenees in the 1960s a thermal storage wall typically consists of a 4 to 16 in 100 to 400 mm thick masonry wall coated with a dark heatabsorbing finish or a selective surface and covered with a single or double layer of high transmissivity glass the glass is typically placed from ¾ in to 2 in from the wall to create a small airspace in some designs the mass is located 1 to 2 ft 0.6 m away from the glass but the space is still not useable see photos 16.20 and 16.21 the surface of the thermal mass absorbs the solar radiation that strikes it and stores it for nighttime use unlike a direct gain system the thermal storage wall system provides passive solar heating without excessive window area and glare in interior spaces however the ability to take advantage of views and daylighting are eliminated the performance of trombe walls is diminished if the wall interior is not open to the interior spaces furniture bookshelves and wall cabinets installed on the interior surface of the wall will reduce its performance a classical trombe wall also generically called a vented thermal storage wall has operable vents near the ceiling and floor levels of the mass wall that allow indoor air to flow through them by natural convection as solar radiation heats the air trapped between the glass and wall and it begins to rise air is drawn into the lower vent then into the space between the glass and wall to get heated by solar radiation increasing its temperature and causing it to rise and then exit through the top ceiling vent back into the indoor space this allows the wall to directly introduce heated air into the space usually at a temperature of about 90 °f 32 °c see figure 16.10 if vents are left open at night or on cloudy days a reversal of convective airflow will occur wasting heat by dissipating it outdoors vents must be closed at night so radiant heat from the interior surface of the storage wall heats the indoor space generally vents are also closed during summer months when heat gain is not needed during the summer an exterior exhaust vent installed at the top of the wall can be opened to vent to the outside such venting makes the system act as a solar chimney driving air through the building during the day vented thermal storage walls vented to the interior have proven somewhat ineffective mostly because they deliver too much heat during the day in mild weather and during summer months they simply overheat and create comfort issues most solar experts recommended that thermal storage walls should not be vented to the interior there are many variations of the trombe wall system an unvented thermal storage wall technically not a trombe wall captures solar energy on the exterior surface heats up and conducts heat to the interior surface where it radiates from the interior wall surface to the indoor space later in the day a water wall uses a type of thermal mass that consists of tanks or tubes of water used as thermal mass a typical unvented thermal storage wall consists of a south facing masonry or concrete wall with a dark heatabsorbing material on the exterior surface and faced with a single or double layer of glass high transmission glass maximizes solar gains to the mass wall the glass is placed from ¾ to 6 in 20 to 150 mm from the wall to create a small airspace glass framing is typically metal eg aluminum because vinyl will soften and wood will become super dried at the 180 °f 82 °c temperature that can exist behind the glass in the wall heat from sunlight passing through the glass is absorbed by the dark surface stored in the wall and conducted slowly inward through the masonry as an architectural detail patterned glass can limit the exterior visibility of the wall without sacrificing solar transmissivity a water wall uses containers of water for thermal mass instead of a solid mass wall water walls are typically slightly more efficient than solid mass walls because they absorb heat more efficiently due to the development of convective currents in the liquid water as it is heated these currents cause rapid mixing and quicker transfer of heat into the building than can be provided by the solid mass walls temperature variations between the exterior and interior wall surfaces drive heat through the mass wall inside the building however daytime heat gain is delayed only becoming available at the interior surface of the thermal mass during the evening when it is needed because the sun has set the time lag is the time difference between when sunlight first strikes the wall and when the heat enters the building interior time lag is contingent upon the type of material used in the wall and the wall thickness a greater thickness yields a greater time lag the time lag characteristic of thermal mass combined with dampening of temperature fluctuations allows the use of varying daytime solar energy as a more uniform nighttime heat source windows can be placed in the wall for natural lighting or aesthetic reasons but this tends to lower the efficiency somewhat the thickness of a thermal storage wall should be approximately 10 to 14 in 250 to 350 mm for brick 12 to 18 in 300 to 450 mm for concrete 8 to 12 in 200 to 300 mm for earthadobe and at least 6 in 150 mm for water these thicknesses delay movement of heat such that indoor surface temperatures peak during late evening hours heat will take about 8 to 10 hours to reach the interior of the building heat travels through a concrete wall at rate of about one inch per hour a good thermal connection between the inside wall finishes eg drywall and the thermal mass wall is necessary to maximize heat transfer to the interior space although the position of a thermal storage wall minimizes daytime overheating of the indoor space a wellinsulated building should be limited to approximately 0.2 to 0.3 ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated 0.2 to 0.3 m2 per m2 of floor area depending upon climate a water wall should have about 0.15 to 0.2 ft2 of water wall surface per ft2 0.15 to 0.2 m2 per m2 of floor area thermal mass walls are bestsuited to sunny winter climates that have high diurnal daynight temperature swings eg southwest mountainwest they do not perform as well in cloudy or extremely cold climates or in climates where there is not a large diurnal temperature swing nighttime thermal losses through the thermal mass of the wall can still be significant in cloudy and cold climates the wall loses stored heat in less than a day and then leak heat which dramatically raises backup heating requirements covering the glazing with tightfitting moveable insulation panels during lengthy cloudy periods and nighttime hours will enhance performance of a thermal storage system the main drawback of thermal storage walls is their heat loss to the outside double glass glass or any of the plastics is necessary for reducing heat loss in most climates in mild climates single glass is acceptable a selective surface highabsorbinglowemitting surface applied to the exterior surface of the thermal storage wall improves performance by reducing the amount of infrared energy radiated back through the glass typically it achieves a similar improvement in performance without the need for daily installation and removal of insulating panels a selective surface consists of a sheet of metal foil glued to the outside surface of the wall it absorbs almost all the radiation in the visible portion of the solar spectrum and emits very little in the infrared range high absorbency turns the light into heat at the walls surface and low emittance prevents the heat from radiating back towards the glass21 roof pond system a roof pond passive solar system sometimes called a solar roof uses water stored on the roof to temper hot and cold internal temperatures usually in desert environments it typically is constructed of containers holding 6 to 12 in 150 to 300 mm of water on a flat roof water is stored in large plastic bags or fiberglass containers to maximize radiant emissions and minimize evaporation it can be left unglazed or can be covered by glazing solar radiation heats the water which acts as a thermal storage medium at night or during cloudy weather the containers can be covered with insulating panels the indoor space below the roof pond is heated by thermal energy emitted by the roof pond storage above these systems require good drainage systems movable insulation and an enhanced structural system to support a 35 to 70 lbft2 1.7 to 3.3 knm2 dead load with the angles of incidence of sunlight during the day roof ponds are only effective for heating at lower and midlatitudes in hot to temperate climates roof pond systems perform better for cooling in hot low humidity climates not many solar roofs have been built and there is limited information on the design cost performance and construction details of thermal storage roofs21 isolated solar system in an isolated gain passive solar system the components eg collector and thermal storage are isolated from the indoor area of the building21 an attached sunspace also sometimes called a solar room or solarium is a type of isolated gain solar system with a glazed interior space or room that is part of or attached to a building but which can be completely closed off from the main occupied areas it functions like an attached greenhouse that makes use of a combination of directgain and indirectgain system characteristics a sunspace may be called and appear like a greenhouse but a greenhouse is designed to grow plants whereas a sunspace is designed to provide heat and aesthetics to a building sunspaces are very popular passive design elements because they expand the living areas of a building and offer a room to grow plants and other vegetation in moderate and cold climates however supplemental space heating is required to keep plants from freezing during extremely cold weather an attached sunspace’s southfacing glass collects solar energy as in a directgain system the simplest sunspace design is to install vertical windows with no overhead glazing sunspaces may experience high heat gain and high heat loss through their abundance of glazing although horizontal and sloped glazing collects more heat in the winter it is minimized to prevent overheating during summer months although overhead glazing can be aesthetically pleasing an insulated roof provides better thermal performance skylights can be used to provide some daylighting potential vertical glazing can maximize gain in winter when the angle of the sun is low and yield less heat gain during the summer vertical glass is less expensive easier to install and insulate and not as prone to leaking fogging breaking and other glass failures a combination of vertical glazing and some sloped glazing is acceptable if summer shading is provided a welldesigned overhang may be all that is necessary to shade the glazing in the summer the temperature variations caused by the heat losses and gains can be moderated by thermal mass and lowemissivity windows thermal mass can include a masonry floor a masonry wall bordering the house or water containers distribution of heat to the building can be accomplished through ceiling and floor level vents windows doors or fans in a common design thermal mass wall situated on the back of the sunspace adjacent to the living space will function like an indirectgain thermal mass wall solar energy entering the sunspace is retained in the thermal mass solar heat is conveyed into the building by conduction through the shared mass wall in the rear of the sunspace and by vents like an unvented thermal storage wall or through openings in the wall that permit airflow from the sunspace to the indoor space by convection like a vented thermal storage wall see figure 16.12 examples of sunspaces are shown in photos 16.33 through 16.35 in cold climates double glazing should be used to reduce conductive losses through the glass to the outside nighttime heat loss although significant during winter months is not as essential in the sunspace as with direct gain systems since the sunspace can be closed off from the rest of the building in temperate and cold climates thermally isolating the sunspace from the building at night is important large glass panels french doors or sliding glass doors between the building and attached sunspace will maintain an open feeling without the heat loss associated with an open space a sunspace with a masonry thermal wall will need approximately 0.3 ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated 0.3 m2 per m2 of floor area depending on climate wall thicknesses should be similar to a thermal storage wall if a water wall is used between the sunspace and living space about 0.20 ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated 0.2 m2 per m2 of floor area is appropriate in most climates a ventilation system is required in summer months to prevent overheating generally vast overhead horizontal and east and westfacing glass areas should not be used in a sunspace without special precautions for summer overheating such as using heatreflecting glass and providing summershading systems areas the internal surfaces of the thermal mass should be dark in color movable insulation eg window coverings shades shutters can be used help trap the warm air in the sunspace both after the sun has set and during cloudy weather when closed during extremely hot days window coverings can help keep the sunspace from overheating to maximize comfort and efficiency the nonglass sunspace walls ceiling and foundation should be well insulated the perimeter of the foundation wall or slab should be insulated to the frost line or around the slab perimeter in a temperate or cold climate the east and west walls of the sunspace should be insulated no glass additional measures measures should be taken to reduce heat loss at night eg window coverings or movable window insulation heat storage the sun doesnt shine all the time heat storage or thermal mass keeps the building warm when the sun cant heat it in diurnal solar houses the storage is designed for one or a few days the usual method is a customconstructed thermal mass this includes a trombe wall a ventilated concrete floor a cistern water wall or roof pond22 it is also feasible to use the thermal mass of the earth itself either asis or by incorporation into the structure by banking or using rammed earth as a structural medium23 in subarctic areas or areas that have long terms without solar gain eg weeks of freezing fog purposebuilt thermal mass is very expensive don stephens pioneered an experimental technique to use the ground as thermal mass large enough for annualized heat storage his designs run an isolated thermosiphon 3 m under a house and insulate the ground with a 6 m waterproof skirt24 insulation main article building insulation thermal insulation or superinsulation type placement and amount reduces unwanted leakage of heat10 some passive buildings are actually constructed of insulation special glazing systems and window coverings main articles insulated glazing and window covering the effectiveness of direct solar gain systems is significantly enhanced by insulative eg double glazing spectrally selective glazing lowe or movable window insulation window quilts bifold interior insulation shutters shades etc25 generally equatorfacing windows should not employ glazing coatings that inhibit solar gain there is extensive use of superinsulated windows in the german passive house standard selection of different spectrally selective window coating depends on the ratio of heating versus cooling degree days for the design location glazing selection equatorfacing glass the requirement for vertical equatorfacing glass is different from the other three sides of a building reflective window coatings and multiple panes of glass can reduce useful solar gain however directgain systems are more dependent on double or triple glazing to reduce heat loss indirectgain and isolatedgain configurations may still be able to function effectively with only singlepane glazing nevertheless the optimal costeffective solution is both location and system dependent roofangle glass and skylights skylights admit harsh direct overhead sunlight and glare26 either horizontally a flat roof or pitched at the same angle as the roof slope in some cases horizontal skylights are used with reflectors to increase the intensity of solar radiation and harsh glare depending on the roof angle of incidence when the winter sun is low on the horizon most solar radiation reflects off of roof angled glass  the angle of incidence is nearly parallel to roofangled glass morning and afternoon  when the summer sun is high it is nearly perpendicular to roofangled glass which maximizes solar gain at the wrong time of year and acts like a solar furnace skylights should be covered and wellinsulated to reduce natural convection  warm air rising  heat loss on cold winter nights and intense solar heat gain during hot springsummerfall days the equatorfacing side of a building is south in the northern hemisphere and north in the southern hemisphere skylights on roofs that face away from the equator provide mostly indirect illumination except for summer days when the sun may rise on the nonequator side of the building at some latitudes skylights on eastfacing roofs provide maximum direct light and solar heat gain in the summer morning westfacing skylights provide afternoon sunlight and heat gain during the hottest part of the day some skylights have expensive glazing that partially reduces summer solar heat gain while still allowing some visible light transmission however if visible light can pass through it so can some radiant heat gain they are both electromagnetic radiation waves you can partially reduce some of the unwanted roofangledglazing summer solar heat gain by installing a skylight in the shade of deciduous leafshedding trees or by adding a movable insulated opaque window covering on the inside or outside of the skylight this would eliminate the daylight benefit in the summer if tree limbs hang over a roof they will increase problems with leaves in rain gutters possibly cause roofdamaging ice dams shorten roof life and provide an easier path for pests to enter your attic leaves and twigs on skylights are unappealing difficult to clean and can increase the glazing breakage risk in wind storms sawtooth roof glazing with verticalglassonly can bring some of the passive solar building design benefits into the core of a commercial or industrial building without the need for any roofangled glass or skylights skylights provide daylight the only view they provide is essentially straight up in most applications wellinsulated light tubes can bring daylight into northern rooms without using a skylight a passivesolar greenhouse provides abundant daylight for the equatorside of the building infrared thermography color thermal imaging cameras  used in formal energy audits  can quickly document the negative thermal impact of roofangled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day the us department of energy states vertical glazing is the overall best option for sunspaces27 roofangled glass and sidewall glass are not recommended for passive solar sunspaces the us doe explains drawbacks to roofangled glazing glass and plastic have little structural strength when installed vertically glass or plastic bears its own weight because only a small area the top edge of the glazing is subject to gravity as the glass tilts off the vertical axis however an increased area now the sloped crosssection of the glazing has to bear the force of gravity glass is also brittle it does not flex much before breaking to counteract this you usually must increase the thickness of the glazing or increase the number of structural supports to hold the glazing both increase overall cost and the latter will reduce the amount of solar gain into the sunspace another common problem with sloped glazing is its increased exposure to the weather it is difficult to maintain a good seal on roofangled glass in intense sunlight hail sleet snow and wind may cause material failure for occupant safety regulatory agencies usually require sloped glass to be made of safety glass laminated or a combination thereof which reduce solar gain potential most of the roofangled glass on the crowne plaza hotel orlando airport sunspace was destroyed in a single windstorm roofangled glass increases construction cost and can increase insurance premiums vertical glass is less susceptible to weather damage than roofangled glass it is difficult to control solar heat gain in a sunspace with sloped glazing during the summer and even during the middle of a mild and sunny winter day skylights are the antithesis of zero energy building passive solar cooling in climates with an air conditioning requirement angle of incident radiation the amount of solar gain transmitted through glass is also affected by the angle of the incident solar radiation sunlight striking glass within 20 degrees of perpendicular is mostly transmitted through the glass whereas sunlight at more than 35 degrees from perpendicular is mostly reflected28 all of these factors can be modeled more precisely with a photographic light meter and a heliodon or optical bench which can quantify the ratio of reflectivity to transmissivity based on angle of incidence alternatively passive solar computer software can determine the impact of sun path and coolingandheating degree days on energy performance regional climatic conditions are often available from local weather services operable shading and insulation devices a design with too much equatorfacing glass can result in excessive winter spring or fall day heating uncomfortably bright living spaces at certain times of the year and excessive heat transfer

architecture other passive solar principles passive solar lighting main article passive solar lighting passive solar lighting techniques enhance taking advantage of natural illumination for interiors and so reduce reliance on artificial lighting systems this can be achieved by careful building design orientation and placement of window sections to collect light other creative solutions involve the use of reflecting surfaces to admit daylight into the interior of a building window sections should be adequately sized and to avoid overillumination can be shielded with a brise soleil awnings well placed trees glass coatings and other passive and active devices29 another major issue for many window systems is that they can be potentially vulnerable sites of excessive thermal gain or heat loss whilst high mounted clerestory window and traditional skylights can introduce daylight in poorly oriented sections of a building unwanted heat transfer may be hard to control3031 thus energy that is saved by reducing artificial lighting is often more than offset by the energy required for operating hvac systems to maintain thermal comfort various methods can be employed to address this including but not limited to window coverings insulated glazing and novel materials such as aerogel semitransparent insulation optical fiber embedded in walls or roof or hybrid solar lighting at oak ridge

and clear or translucent glassed hinged doors and  take the captured light and passively reflect it further inside the light can be from passive windows or skylights and solar light tubes or from active daylighting sources in traditional japanese architecture the shōji sliding panel doors with translucent washi screens are an original precedent international style modernist and midcentury modern architecture were earlier innovators of this passive penetration and reflection in industrial commercial and residential applications passive solar water heating main article solar hot water there are many ways to use solar thermal energy to heat water for domestic use different activeandpassive solar hot water technologies have different locationspecific economic cost benefit analysis implications fundamental passive solar hot water heating involves no pumps or anything electrical it is very cost effective in climates that do not have lengthy subfreezing or verycloudy weather conditions32 other active solar water heating technologies etc may be more appropriate for some locations it is possible to have active solar hot water which is also capable of being off grid and qualifies as sustainable this is done by the use of a photovoltaic cell which uses energy from the sun to power the pumps33 comparison to the passive house standard in europe main article passive house there is growing momentum in europe for the approach espoused by the passive house passivhaus in german institute in germany rather than relying solely on traditional passive solar design techniques this approach seeks to make use of all passive sources of heat minimises energy usage and emphasises the need for high levels of insulation reinforced by meticulous attention to detail in order to address thermal bridging and cold air infiltration most of the buildings built to the passive house standard also incorporate an active heat recovery ventilation unit with or without a small typically 1 kw incorporated heating component the energy design of passive house buildings is developed using a spreadsheetbased modeling tool called the passive house planning package phpp which is updated periodically the current version is phpp2007 where 2007 is the year of issue a building may be certified as a passive house when it can be shown that it meets certain criteria the most important being that the annual specific heat demand for the house should not exceed 15kwhm2a design tools traditionally a heliodon was used to simulate the altitude and azimuth of the sun shining on a model building at any time of any day of the year34 in modern times computer programs can model this phenomenon and integrate local climate data including site impacts such as overshadowing and physical obstructions to predict the solar gain potential for a particular building design over the course of a year gpsbased smartphone applications can now do this inexpensively on a hand held device these design tools provide the passive solar designer the ability to evaluate local conditions design elements and orientation prior to construction energy performance optimization normally requires an iterativerefinement designandevaluate process there is no such thing as a onesizefitsall universal passive solar building design that would work well in all locations levels of application many detached suburban houses can achieve reductions in heating expense without obvious changes to their appearance comfort or usability35 this is done using good siting and window positioning small amounts of thermal mass with goodbutconventional insulation weatherization and an occasional supplementary heat source such as a central radiator connected to a solar water heater sunrays may fall on a wall during the daytime and raise the temperature of its thermal mass this will then radiate heat into the building in the evening external shading or a radiant barrier plus air gap may be used to reduce undesirable summer solar gain an extension of the passive solar approach to seasonal solar capture and storage of heat and cooling these designs attempt to capture warmseason solar heat and convey it to a seasonal thermal store for use months later during the cold season annualised passive solar increased storage is achieved by employing large amounts of thermal mass or  anecdotal reports suggest they can be effective but no formal study has been conducted to demonstrate their superiority the approach also can move cooling into the warm season examples pahs  by john hait annualized geothermal solar ags heating  by don stephen earthedroof a purely passive solarheated house would have no mechanical furnace unit relying instead on energy captured from sunshine only supplemented by incidental heat energy given off by lights computers and other taskspecific appliances such as those for cooking entertainment etc showering people and pets the use of natural convection air currents rather than mechanical devices such as fans to circulate air is related though not strictly solar design passive solar building design sometimes uses limited electrical and mechanical controls to operate dampers insulating shutters shades awnings or reflectors some systems enlist small fans or solarheated chimneys to improve convective airflow a reasonable way to analyse these systems is by measuring their coefficient of performance a heat pump might use 1 j for every 4 j it delivers giving a cop of 4 a system that only uses a 30 w fan to moreevenly distribute 10 kw of solar heat through an entire house would have a cop of 300 passive solar building design is often a foundational element of a costeffective zero energy building3637 although a zeb uses multiple passive solar building design concepts a zeb is usually not purely passive having active mechanical renewable energy generation systems such as wind turbine photovoltaics micro hydro geothermal and other emerging alternative energy sources passive solar design on skyscrapers there has been recent interest in the utilization of the large amounts of surface area on skyscrapers to improve their overall energy efficiency because skyscrapers are increasingly ubiquitous in urban environments yet require large amounts of energy to operate there is potential for large amounts of energy savings employing passive solar design techniques one study38 which analyzed the proposed 22 bishopsgate tower in london found that a 35% energy decrease in demand can theoretically be achieved through indirect solar gains by rotating the building to achieve optimum ventilation and daylight penetration usage of high thermal mass flooring material to decrease temperature fluctuation inside the building and using double or triple glazed low emissivity window glass for direct solar gain indirect solar gain techniques included moderating wall heat flow by variations of wall thickness from 20 to 30 cm using window glazing on the outdoor space to prevent heat loss dedicating 1520% of floor area for thermal storage and implementing a trombe wall to absorb heat entering the space overhangs are used to block direct sunlight in the summer and allow it in the winter and heat reflecting blinds are inserted between the thermal wall and the glazing to limit heat buildup in the summer months another study39 analyzed doublegreen skin facade dgsf on the outside of high rise buildings in hong kong such a green facade or vegetation covering the outer walls can combat the usage of air conditioning greatly  as much as 80% as discovered by the researchers in more temperate climates strategies such as glazing adjustment of windowtowall ratio sun shading and roof strategies can offer considerable energy savings in the 30% to 60% range40 see also site analysis daylighting energy plus house list of lowenergy building techniques list of pioneering solar buildings low energy building
