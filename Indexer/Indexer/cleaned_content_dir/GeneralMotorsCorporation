corporation was formed on september 16 1908 in flint michigan as a holding company controlled by william c durant owner of buick12 at the beginning of the 20th century there were fewer than 8,000 automobiles in america and durant had become a leading manufacturer of horsedrawn vehicles in flint before making his foray into the automotive industry13 gms cofounder was charles stewart mott whose carriage company was merged into buick prior to gms creation over the years mott became the largest single stockholder in gm and spent his life with his mott foundation which has benefited the city of flint his adopted home gm acquired oldsmobile later that year in 1909 durant brought in cadillac elmore oakland and several others also in 1909 gm acquired the reliance motor truck company of owosso michigan and the rapid motor vehicle company of pontiac michigan the predecessors of gmc truck durant along with r s mclaughlin lost control of gm in 1910 to a bankers trust because of the large amount of debt taken on in its acquisitions coupled with a collapse in new vehicle sales14 the longestlived continuous automobile nameplate still in production in the world is the chevrolet suburban15 the next year durant started the chevrolet motor car company in the us and in canada in 1915 and through this he secretly purchased a controlling interest in gm durant took back control of the company after one of the most dramatic proxy wars in american business history durant then reorganized general motors company into general motors corporation in 1916 merging chevrolet with gm and merging general motors of canada limited as an ally in 1918 shortly thereafter he again lost control this time for good after the new vehicle market collapsed alfred p sloan was picked to take charge of the corporation and led it to its postwar global dominance when the seven manufacturing facilities operated by chevrolet before gm acquired the company began to contribute to gm operations these facilities were added to the individual factories that were exclusive to cadillac buick oldsmobile oakland and other companies acquired by gm this unprecedented growth of gm would last into the early

also general motors technical center and general motors proving grounds research and development rd at general motors began organically as the continuation of such rd as the various divisions eg cadillac buick olds oakland were already doing for themselves before the merger its character was entirely empirical it was whatever key people in each company had been competent enough to organize and pursue s carriage company in 1876 was designing and inventing carriage gear the mclaughlin companies became general motors of canada limited charles f ketterings dayton engineering laboratories company delco at dayton ohio was still an independent firm at this time its work was well known to gm central management through its relationship as a supplier and consultancy to cadillac and buick in 1916 durant organized the united motors corporation as an amalgamation of parts suppliers supplying gm and other oems but independent of gm78 alfred p sloan head of the newly acquired hyatt roller bearing corporation became united motors ceo united motors acquired delco and kettering began his association with sloan united motors also acquired at this time the original remy corporation78 called the remy electric company a competitor of delco in 1918 general motors bought united motors78 various entities grew out of the original delco and remy including the dayton metal products corporation the general motors research corporation the delco division and remy electric division of gm delco remy now remy international inc acdelco delco electronics and others todays main successor corporation is delphi automotive which nowadays is an independent parent corporation the general motors research corporation at dayton under kettering became a true automotive research center during the next few decades it led the development of many electricalappliance features for cars and trucks in 1911 charles f kettering with henry m leland of dayton engineering laboratories company delco invented and filed us patent 1,150,523 for the first electric starter in america in 1914 cadillac produced the first massproduced production v8 in the world79 in 1921 general motors patented the use of tetraethyllead as an antiknock agent leading to the development of higher compression engines resulting in more power and efficiency80 in 1937 jominy  boegehold81 of gm invented the jominy endquench test for hardenability of carbon steel a breakthrough in heat treating still in use today as astm a255.82 in 1939 gm introduced the worlds first automatic transmission the hydramatic for the 1940 oldsmobile and would be adopted by the auto industry later83 in 1962 gm introduced the first turbo charged engine in the world for a car in the oldsmobile cutlass turbojetfire84 in 1971 the lunar rover a partnership between gms delco defense electronics division and boeing traversed the surface of the moon 85 in 1972 gm produced the first rear wheel antilock brake system in the world for two of their cars the toronado and eldorado86 in 1984 robert lee87 of gm invented the fe14nd2b permanent magnet fabricated by rapid solidification dichlorodifluoromethane refrigerant for hvac and refrigeration applications freon r12 recognized today as a bad idea environmentally being a chlorofluorocarbon cfc but a technological wonder of its day commercially practical twostroke diesel engines better transmissions for tracklaying vehicles many other advancements although gm rd as it is known in colloquial shorthand began as an organization largely built around one man kettering it eventually evolved into a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them world war ii was a turning point wherein military affairs after mingling with the technologies of applied science for some 80 years first started to become fundamentally reinvented by them civilian life too changed in this direction by the 1950s corporations such as gm and many others were facing a new era of rd different from earlier ones less about genius inventors and individual inventions and more about organizational progress and integrated systems it raised new questions about where the capital for rd would come from in an era of limitless demand for rd although not necessarily for production alfred sloan longtime ceo of gm 1920s to 1960s discussed in his memoir also considered a seminal management treatise the relationships between government academia and private industry in the areas of basic science and applied science in light of this new era88 the views he laid out reflected and influenced wide consensus on these relationships that persists largely to today today gm rd headquartered in warren michigan is a network of six laboratories six science offices and collaborative relationships in over twelve countries including working relationships with universities government groups suppliers and other partners from across the globe on september 7 2014 at the intelligent transport systems world congress in detroit gm disclosed it would be introducing autopilot features into certain 2017 models of its cars which would go on sale in 2016 the super cruise or vehicletovehicle v2v technology is likely to be first introduced to the cadillac range enabling drivers to switch in and out of semiautomated mode89 in december of 2016 general motors announced it would begin testing selfdriving vehicles on public roads in michigan after gov rick snyder signed a package of bills legalizing the operation of autonomous vehicles90 in march 2016 general motors bought cruise automation a san francisco selfdriving vehicle startup to develop selfdriving cars that could be used in ridesharing fleets9192 small car sales chevrolet aveo concept later went into production as the chevrolet aveo uk and the chevrolet sonic us from the 1920s onward general motors always maintained an internal dialog about what its economycar and smallcar policies should be9394 the economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped although a strong distinction was always drawn in the 20th century between policies for the us market and policies for other markets economy in some form always had good demand anywhere but its definition in the us was long considered different from that in other markets in this view economy in the us did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the us the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in nonus markets than in the us and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing93 gms acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd uk 192593 and adam opel ag germany 1929,93 rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision93 although gm since the 1920s has always offered economy models in the us market relative to that markets definition in any given decade and had done research and development in the 1940s and 1950s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the us market94 it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the us market in the 1970s through 1990s gms response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most americans despite anything they said to the contrary did not actually demand at purchasingdecision time small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent although some us consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose such as 1973 and 1979 they flocked equally enthusiastically to suvs when cheap fuel of the 1980s and 1990s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choices since the return of high fuel prices in the 2000s and 2010s gms interest in truly smallcar programs for the us market has been renewed as part of general motors company development gm revived one of its idled us factories for the production of a small car in orion michigan with the creation of 1,200 american jobs this will be the first time ever that a large manufacturer produces a supermini vehicle in the united states this retooled plant will be capable of building 160,000 cars annually including both small and compact vehicles production started in late 2011 with the chevrolet sonic95 environmental initiatives the 2011 chevrolet volt a plugin electric vehicle second generation chevrolet volt general motors has published principles regarding the environment and maintains an extensive website to inform the public in 2008 general motors committed to engineering half of its manufacturing plants to be landfillfree in order to achieve its landfillfree status production waste is recycled or reused in the manufacturing process the worlds largest rooftop solar power installation was installed at general motors spanish zaragoza manufacturing plant in fall 2008 the zaragoza solar installation has about 2,000,000 square feet 190,000 m2 of roof at the plant and contains about 85,000 solar panels the installation was created owned and operated by veolia environment and clairvoyant energy who lease the rooftop area from general motors969798 in 2011 general motors also invested 7.5 million in solarpanel provider sunlogics which will install solar panels on gm facilities99 gm has long worked on alternativetechnology vehicles and has led the industry with ethanolburning flexiblefuel vehicles that can run on either e85 ethanol or gasoline the company was the first to use turbochargers and was an early proponent of v6 engines in the 1960s but quickly lost interest as muscle car popularity increased they demonstrated100 gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene an area of interest throughout the industry but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the 1973 oil crisis in the 1970s and 1980s gm pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies with disastrous results due to poor durability in the oldsmobile diesels and drivability issues in the cadillac v864 variablecylinder engines in 1987 gm in conjunction with aerovironment built the sunraycer which won the inaugural world solar challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology much of the technology from sunraycer found its way into the impact prototype electric vehicle also built by aerovironment and was the predecessor to the general motors ev1 gm supported a compromise version of the corporate average fuel economy cafe standard increase from 27 to 35 mpg‑us 8.7 to 6.7 l100 km 32 to 42 mpg‑imp the first such increase in over 20 years101 gm announced they will introduce more voltbased plugin hybrids hybrid electric vehicles chevrolet tahoe hybrid in may 2004 gm delivered the worlds first fullsized hybrid pickups the 12ton silveradosierra these mild hybrids did not use electrical energy for propulsion like gms later designs in 2005 the opel astra diesel hybrid concept vehicle was introduced the 2006 saturn vue green line was the first hybrid passenger vehicle from gm and is also a mild design gm has hinted at new hybrid technologies to be employed that will be optimized for higher speeds in freeway driving gm currently offers the 2mode hybrid system used by the chevrolet tahoegmc yukoncadillac escalade and gm 12 halfton pickups and will later be used on other vehicles102 within the framework of its vehicle electrification strategy103 gm introduced the

as the ev1 for the 1996 model year it was available through dealers located in only a few regions eg california arizona georgia vehicles were leased rather than sold to individuals in 1999 gm decided to cease production of the vehicles when the individual leases had expired they declined to renew the leases or allow the lessors to purchase them all of the ev1s were eventually returned to general motors and with the exception of a few which were donated to museums all were destroyed the documentary film who killed the electric car covered the ev1 story the ev1s cancellation had disappointed supporters of electric vehicles in 2010 gm debuted the chevrolet volt an plugin hybrid electric vehicle with backup generators powered by gasoline rangeextended electric vehicle106 general motors has

at any speed by ralph nader published in 1965 is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety the subject for which the book is probably most widely known the rearengined gm chevrolet corvair is covered in the first chapter it relates to the first 1960–1964 models that had a swingaxle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances in substitution for the costcutting lack of a front stabilizer bar antiroll bar corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturers recommended tolerances the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential 15psi front 26psi rear when cold 18 psi and 30psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was a dangerous oversteer153 in early march 1966 several media outlets including the new republic and the new york times reported that gm had tried to discredit ralph nader hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations154155 nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for 425,000 naders lawsuit against gm was ultimately decided by the new york court of appeals whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover overzealous surveillance156 nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the proconsumer center for study of responsive law a 1972 safety commission report conducted by texas am university concluded that the 1960–1963 corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations157 the us department of transportation dot issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of nhtsa testing from the previous year nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 corvair and four contemporary cars—a ford falcon plymouth valiant volkswagen beetle and renault dauphine—along with a secondgeneration corvair with its completely redesigned independent rear suspension the 143page report reviewed nhtsas extremecondition handling tests national crashinvolvement data for the cars in the test as well as general motors internal documentation regarding the corvairs handling158 nhtsa went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests this review panel concluded that the 1960–63 corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests  the handling and stability performance of the 1960–63 corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic former gm executive john delorean asserted in his book on a clear day you can see general motors that naders criticisms were valid159 journalist david e davis in a 2009 article in automobile magazine noted that despite naders claim that swingaxle rear suspension were dangerous porsche mercedesbenz and volkswagen all used similar swingaxle concepts during that era160 defective ignition system investigation main article general motors ignition switch scandal in may 2014 the nhtsa fined the company 35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade despite knowing there was a problem with the switches thirteen deaths were attributed to the faulty switches during the time the company failed to recall the cars the 35 million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose congress is considering increasing the maximum fines the regulator can impose from 35 million to 300 million161 general motors has announced that they are also facing 79 customer lawsuits asking for as much as 10 billion for economic losses attributed to the recall162 as well as the cobalts the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars such as the pontiac g5 the saturn ion the chevrolet hhr the saturn sky and pontiac solstice eventually the recall involved about 2.6 million gm cars worldwide163 see also history of
