In the two approaches we are trying to find the links with the word “solar” in either their anchor text or 
in the URL.
In BFS : The crawler crawls the most relevant topics first. It searches for the word solar in the most related documents first and traverses down in depth to get more links. 
In this program we do get 1000 URLs that slowly and gradually lose relation with the topic that is being
searched about. For example it traverses and gives us great answers in the beginning with the top 5 links being the following:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_solar_building_design
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_heating
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_photovoltaics

and then gradually lose connection to the topic by ending up with links about solar eclipse. 
Whereas, 
In DFS: The crawler crawls the most irrelevant topics first. Thus It searches for the word solar in the most unrelated documents that can be traversed down in the depth 5 and gradually gains relevance in the ending documents. 
In this program we get 1000 links that are not related to the seed topic but do have word solar in them.
